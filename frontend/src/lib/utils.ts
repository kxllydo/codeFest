This doesnâ€™t include foreign adoptions, which the U.S. Department of State reports being about 7,000 every year."

        fact: "As of right now, there are more than 107,000 children eligible and waiting for adoption in foster care. The average age of a child waiting for adoption is seven, and 29% of all children will spend at least three years in the system."

Unfortunately, every year about 23,000 children age out of the foster care system without finding a forever family.
